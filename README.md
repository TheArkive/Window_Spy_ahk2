# Window_Spy_ahk2

A direct translation of Window Spy for AHK v1, written for AHK v2.

This is meant to be kept as simple as possible in order to illustrate the main differences between AHK v1 and v2.

There are other more feature-filled versions of this kind of script:

* Steely Wing (for AHK v2)\
https://github.com/steelywing/AutoHotkey-Release/blob/master/installer/source/WindowSpy.v2.ahk

* Alguimist (still only AHK v1 currently)\
